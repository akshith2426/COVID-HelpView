# Main things we should take care in the repo

1. Maintain the nomenclature of the file as CamelCase (SomethingLikeThis.js)
2. All react jsx files should have .jsx extension instead of .js
3. Files without jsx should have .js
4. You can create a server directory if needed 
5. Make sure to use the provided directories and not change the basic structure. but if required you can add new directories and files
6. We'll create separate branches for frontend and backend
